            <h2> Why did I decide to join Lasallian Codespace?</h2>
                <p> I joined here because I want to learn more. The current state of our major subjects isn't that great due to a lack of professors, so I want to take this opportunity to enhance my skills and learn about various topics.</p>
                <p> I also joined to motivate myself to study. I'm used to being lazy and procrastinating so having more activities to do can motivate me to better control my time.</p>
                <p> <strong> So what do I expect from this bootcamp? </strong> Firstly, I'm expecting to broaden my knowledge on the field so I can have a better idea of what I want to focus on in the future. I also want to meet other students and create connections with them.</p>
